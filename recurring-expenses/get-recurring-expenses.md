# Get recurring expenses

Every month, a different set of recurring expenses is expected. This is because recurring expenses can be once a year, twice a year, every 4 months, etc.

If a recurring expense is listed as “twice a month”, then that recurring expense will be returned twice, each with a different billing date based on when the system believes that recurring expense transaction is to be expected. If the recurring expense is listed as “once a week”, then that recurring expense will be returned in this list as many times as there are weeks for the specified month.

In the same vein, if a recurring expense that began last month is set to “Every 3 months”, then that recurring expense will not show up in the results for this month.

{% api-method-parameter name="start\_date" type="string" required=false %}
Accepts a string in ISO-8601 short format. Whatever your start date, the system will automatically return recurring expenses expected for that month. For instance, if you input `2020-01-25`, the system will return recurring expenses which are to be expected between `2020-01-01` to `2020-01-31`. Defaults to the first day of the current month.

{% api-method-parameter name="debit\_as\_negative" type="boolean" required=false %}
Pass in true if you’d like expenses to be returned as negative amounts and credits as positive amounts. Defaults to false.
